Recipes Project from the Foundations Course of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes  

This assignments instructs me to build a basic HTML website starting with an index.html page that links to a series of different recipes. I have chosen seafood as it's my favourite. This project will test my HTML knowledge as well as help me practise and familiarise myself with using GitHub and git commands such as commit and add.
